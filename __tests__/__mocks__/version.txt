MAME v0.180 (unknown)
Copyright Nicola Salmoria and the MAME team

This software reproduces, more or less faithfully, the behaviour of a wide range
of machines. But hardware is useless without software, so images of the ROMs and
other media which run on that hardware are also required.

Usage:  mame64 [machine] [media] [software] [options]

        mame64 -showusage    for a brief list of options
        mame64 -showconfig   for a list of configuration options
        mame64 -listmedia    for a full list of supported media
        mame64 -createconfig to create a mame.ini

For usage instructions, please consult the files config.txt and windows.txt.
